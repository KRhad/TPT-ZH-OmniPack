TPT-ZH-OmniPack / Omniverse Sandbox Integration
================================================

This repository is an unofficial GPL-3.0, content-first free-sandbox integration based on The Powder Toy `100.0.399`. It has no player tasks, achievements, technology tree, discovery progression, or forced element unlocks: every enabled OmniPack material is directly available. The current development tree provides Simplified Chinese and English interfaces and 466 directly selectable materials across metallurgy, chemistry, nuclear technology, the full periodic table, electronics, ecology, and environmental pollution. The engine has 487 active non-alias types in total; that broader internal count includes the eraser and upstream hidden transition/helper types and is not advertised as the menu material count.

The 118-element source map reuses 26 existing pure-element implementations and fixes stable IDs `370..461` for the remaining 92; all 118 mappings are directly placeable. A compiled standard long-form periodic-table panel supports bilingual name/symbol/atomic-number/identifier search, state/radioactivity/metal-class filters, category colours, and an expandable f-block. The newest content block uses stable IDs `670..685` for sixteen distinct ecology and pollution materials with local water treatment, contamination, finite biological growth, smog, acid rain, and recovery reactions under the Biology module's shared `1024`-event-per-frame limit.

The development branch has committed clean-build, automated registration, bilingual content, gameplay, disabled-module, OPS roundtrip, and content-freeze stress-smoke evidence. The source, mod-reference, font, resource, and static-library license closure now passes with unknown sources excluded, but the project is **not release-ready**: trusted GUI/DPI checks, formal 600-second stress sampling, the two-hour long run, a final package audit, an authorized public source remote, tag, and public release remain incomplete. The existing `origin` is a historical Chinese-fork remote and must not be represented as the public source for this candidate.

See [README.zh-CN.md](README.zh-CN.md), [docs/VERSION_GATES.md](docs/VERSION_GATES.md), [docs/PHASE_0_2_EVIDENCE.md](docs/PHASE_0_2_EVIDENCE.md), and [dist/release-report-0.1.0-test.md](dist/release-report-0.1.0-test.md) for the scoped evidence and blockers.

Have you ever wanted to blow something up? Or maybe you always dreamt of operating an atomic power plant? Do you have a will to develop your own CPU? The Powder Toy lets you to do all of these, and even more!

The Powder Toy is a free physics sandbox game, which simulates air pressure and velocity, heat, gravity and a countless number of interactions between different substances! The game provides you with various building materials, liquids, gases and electronic components which can be used to construct complex machines, guns, bombs, realistic terrains and almost anything else. You can then mine them and watch cool explosions, add intricate wirings, play with little stickmen or operate your machine. You can browse and play thousands of different saves made by the community or upload your own – we welcome your creations!

There is a Lua API – you can automate your work or even make plugins for the game. The Powder Toy is free and the source code is distributed under the GNU General Public License, so you can modify the game yourself or help with development.
